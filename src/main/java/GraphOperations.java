/* Class GraphOperations is the class that contains a Graph object as instance variable and algorithms that find shortest path & most reliable destination.
    It has instance varible private final Graph graph that represents the graph it will work on.

    Modifier:
    public GraphOperations(Graph graph);

    public static class VertexComparator implements Comparator<Graph.Vertex>;    Overrides java default compare method. This function will compare the weight (biggest probability edge value) of two vertexes and return 1 if the second vertex is larger than the first vertex. -1 if the first one has greater weight than the second, and 0 if they have equal weight.

    public void resetGraphVertices();    that resets the graph value to default (0 weight and null vertexes).

    HighestProbPathProperty findHighestProbPath (Graph.Vertex startVertex, Graph.Vertex endVertex)    that finds the path with highest probability. The algorithm is to traverse the graph until target vertex is reached. In the process, it will always choose the edge with the highest probability to travel. In case of same probability, it will check a priority queue that stores edgesâ€™ largest probability edge and break the tie. The priority queue contains all vertexes and sorts them in no-increasing order of largest edge probability value.

    public Graph.Vertex findMostReliableDest();    is the function that finds the most reliable destination. It is called findHighestProbPath and calculates the reliable destination value for all vertices and returns the vertex that has highest reliable vertex value.
